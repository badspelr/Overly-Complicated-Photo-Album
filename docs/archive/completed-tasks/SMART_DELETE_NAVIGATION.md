# Smart Delete Navigation Feature

## Date: October 22, 2025

## 📝 Problem
When deleting a photo or video from its detail page, users were redirected to the dashboard, which was disruptive to the browsing flow.

**Example:**
- User viewing: `/photos/27/?return_url=/albums/1/`
- Clicks "Delete Photo"
- Photo deleted ✅
- Redirected to: `/dashboard/` ❌ (loses context)

## ✨ Solution
Implemented smart navigation that:
1. Deletes the photo/video
2. Finds the **next item** in the same album
3. Redirects to the next item's detail page
4. If it was the last item, redirects to the album page

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Logic Flow

```python
1. User clicks delete on photo/video
2. Before deletion:
   - Get the current album
   - Get all items in album (ordered by date_taken/date_recorded)
   - Find the next item after current one
   - If no next item, find the previous item
3. Delete the media
4. Redirect:
   - If next_item exists → Go to next_item.detail_page
   - If no items left → Go to album.detail_page
```

### Code Changes

**File:** `album/views/media_views.py`

**Function:** `delete_media(request, pk, model)`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Preserves browsing context
- ✅ Works for both photos and videos
- ✅ Respects album ordering (by date_taken/date_recorded/uploaded_at)
- ✅ Falls back to previous item if deleting last item
- ✅ Falls back to album if no items remain

### Ordering Logic

Items are ordered by:
1. **Photos:** `date_taken` (or `uploaded_at` if no date_taken)
2. **Videos:** `date_recorded` (or `uploaded_at` if no date_recorded)
3. Ties broken by `id`

## 📊 User Experience Comparison

### Before (❌ Poor UX)
```
1. User viewing photo 5 of 10 in "Vacation 2025" album
2. Clicks delete
3. Photo deleted
4. Redirected to dashboard
5. User must navigate back to album
6. Find where they were...
```

### After (✅ Great UX)
```
1. User viewing photo 5 of 10 in "Vacation 2025" album
2. Clicks delete
3. Photo deleted
4. Automatically viewing photo 6 of 9
5. Can continue browsing seamlessly
```

## 🎯 Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Deleting Last Item
```
Album has: [Photo A, Photo B]
Delete: Photo B
Result: Redirects to Photo A detail page ✅
```

### Case 2: Deleting Only Item
```
Album has: [Photo A]
Delete: Photo A
Result: Redirects to album detail page ✅
```

### Case 3: Deleting First Item
```
Album has: [Photo A, Photo B, Photo C]
Delete: Photo A
Result: Redirects to Photo B detail page ✅
```

### Case 4: Deleting Middle Item
```
Album has: [Photo A, Photo B, Photo C]
Delete: Photo B
Result: Redirects to Photo C detail page ✅
```

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

   ```

3. **Test Only Item:**

   - Click on the photo
   - Click "Delete Photo"
   - Confirm deletion
   - Should see album detail page
