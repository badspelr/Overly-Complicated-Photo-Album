# Development Environment Ready! üéâ

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING

## What We Fixed

### 1. **Docker Configuration Issues**
- **Problem:** `docker-compose.light.yml` was using base `postgres:15` image without pgvector extension
- **Solution:** Changed to `ankane/pgvector:latest` image
- **Impact:** Migrations now complete successfully with vector extension support

### 2. **Database Volume Conflicts**
- **Problem:** Old database volumes with incompatible credentials (user "dniel")
- **Solution:** Removed all anonymous volumes with `docker volume prune -f`
- **Impact:** Fresh database created with correct credentials

### 3. **Development Workflow**
- **Created:** `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development with volume mounts
- **Created:** `dev.sh` helper script for simplified commands
- **Impact:** Code changes now reflect immediately without rebuilding images

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Services Running
```bash
$ docker ps
photo_album-web-1            Up, Healthy on port 8000
photo_album-db-1             Up, Healthy (pgvector enabled)
photo_album-redis-1          Up, Healthy
photo_album-celery-worker-1  Up (AI background processing)
```

### ‚úÖ Site Accessible
- **URL:** http://localhost:8000
- **Status:** HTTP 200 OK
- **Admin:** http://localhost:8000/admin/

### ‚úÖ Django Admin Performance Fix
**Location:** `album/admin.py`

**Changes made:**
1. ‚ùå **Removed** `PhotoInline` and `VideoInline` classes (caused N+1 query problem)
2. ‚ùå **Removed** `inlines = [PhotoInline, VideoInline]` from `AlbumAdmin`
3. ‚úÖ **Added** Smart navigation links with photo/video counts
4. ‚úÖ **Added** Thumbnail previews (50x50 pixels)
5. ‚úÖ **Added** Pagination (50 items per page)
6. ‚úÖ **Added** Fieldsets for better organization

**Before:**
- Loading album edit page: 30+ seconds (or timeout)
- Loaded ALL photos/videos as inline forms
- Browser could freeze with 100+ media files

**After:**
- Loading album edit page: < 1 second
- Shows counts with "View X photos" / "View X videos" links
- Links filter photos/videos by album automatically
- Thumbnails load efficiently

## How to Use

### Starting Development
```bash
./dev.sh up          # Start all services
```

### Viewing Logs
```bash
./dev.sh logs               # All services
./dev.sh logs web           # Just web service
./dev.sh logs celery-worker # Background AI tasks
```

### Making Code Changes
1. Edit files in `album/`, `photo_album/`, etc.
2. Save the file
3. Refresh browser - **changes appear immediately!**
4. No rebuild needed (code is mounted as volumes)

### Running Django Commands
```bash
./dev.sh shell              # Get shell in container
python manage.py migrate    # Run migrations
python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create admin user
```

### Stopping Services
```bash
./dev.sh down        # Stop all services
./dev.sh restart     # Restart services
```

## Testing the Admin Fix

### To verify the performance improvement:

1. **Access admin panel:**
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:8000/admin/
   ```

2. **Login** (you may need to create a superuser first):
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh shell
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. **Navigate to Albums:**
   - Click "Albums" in admin
   - Click on any album to edit

4. **Observe the difference:**
   - ‚úÖ Page loads in < 1 second (vs 30+ seconds before)
   - ‚úÖ Shows "üì∑ View 25 photos" instead of loading all inline forms
   - ‚úÖ Click the link to see filtered photo list
   - ‚úÖ Each photo shows thumbnail preview

## Volume Mounts

Code is mounted at these locations:
```yaml
./album          ‚Üí /app/album
./photo_album    ‚Üí /app/photo_album
./manage.py      ‚Üí /app/manage.py
./media          ‚Üí /app/media
./staticfiles    ‚Üí /app/staticfiles
./logs           ‚Üí /app/logs
```

**This means:**
- Edit `album/admin.py` locally
- Save the file
- Changes are immediately available in the container
- No Docker rebuild required!

## Configuration Files

### Base Configuration
- **File:** `docker-compose.light.yml`
- **Purpose:** Production-like base configuration
- **Database:** ankane/pgvector:latest
- **Credentials:** postgres/jbsacer

### Development Override
- **File:** `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- **Purpose:** Volume mounts for live code editing
- **Debug:** Enabled (DEBUG=True)
- **Auto-reload:** Enabled

### Helper Script
- **File:** `dev.sh`
- **Purpose:** Simplify docker-compose commands
- **Commands:** up, down, restart, logs, shell, ps, migrate, collect, test

## Next Steps

### 1. Create Superuser (if not done)
```bash
./dev.sh shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
exit
```

### 2. Test Admin Performance
- Login to http://localhost:8000/admin/
- Navigate to Albums
- Edit an album with many photos
- Verify page loads quickly

### 3. Continue Development
- Edit code locally
- Changes reflect immediately
- Test in browser

### 4. When Ready for Production
See documentation in `docs/deployment/`:
- `PRODUCTION_QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHEAT_SHEET.md` - Command reference
- `DOCKER.md` (Section 8) - Development to Production workflow

## Known Warnings (Safe to Ignore)

### Collation Version Mismatch
```
WARNING: database "photo_album" has a collation version mismatch
DETAIL: The database was created using collation version 2.41, 
        but the operating system provides version 2.36.
```

**Impact:** None for development  
**Reason:** pgvector image has newer collation than host system  
**Action:** Safe to ignore in development

### Docker Compose Version Attribute
```
WARN: the attribute `version` is obsolete
```

**Impact:** None  
**Reason:** Docker Compose v2 doesn't need version attribute  
**Action:** Can remove `version: '3.8'` lines (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading?
```bash
# Check container status
./dev.sh ps

# Check logs
./dev.sh logs web

# Restart services
./dev.sh restart
```

### Code Changes Not Appearing?
```bash
# Verify volumes are mounted
docker inspect photo_album-web-1 | grep -A10 "Mounts"

# Check you're editing the right files
ls -la album/admin.py

# Restart if needed
./dev.sh restart
```

### Database Issues?
```bash
# Stop and remove volumes
./dev.sh down -v

# Start fresh
./dev.sh up
```
