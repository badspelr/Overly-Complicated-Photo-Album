## üéØ New Features

### 1. Configurable Album Admin Processing Limit

**What Changed:**
- Album admins can now process AI batches with a configurable limit (previously hardcoded at 50)
- New setting in Django Admin: `album_admin_processing_limit`
- Applies to both photo and video AI processing

**How to Use:**
1. Go to Django Admin ‚Üí AI Processing Settings
2. Adjust "Album admin processing limit" field (default: 50)
3. Save settings
4. Album admins will be limited to this number per batch
5. Site admins always have unlimited processing

**Implementation Details:**
- New field: `AIProcessingSettings.album_admin_processing_limit`
- Default value: 50
- Validation: Must be at least 1
- Updated views: `process_photos_ai` and `process_videos_ai`
- Migration: `0007_add_album_admin_processing_limit`

**Files Modified:**
- `album/models.py` - Added field and validation
- `album/admin.py` - Added to admin interface
- `album/views/media_views.py` - Updated both processing views
- `album/migrations/0007_add_album_admin_processing_limit.py` - Database migration

### 2. Album Owner AI Processing Access

**What Changed:**
- Album owners can now see and access AI processing tools in the navigation menu
- Previously only site admins could see these options
- Links added: "Process Photos AI" and "Process Videos AI"

**User Experience:**
- Album owners see these links alongside "Manage Categories" and "Invite User"
- Permission checks remain in place - album owners can only process their own albums
- Site admins continue to have full access to all albums

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated navigation template: `album/templates/album/base.html`
- Added links to `{% elif user.is_album_owner %}` section
- Backend permissions already supported this (just UI was missing)

**Files Modified:**
- `album/templates/album/base.html` - Added navigation links for album owners

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Bulk Media Operations ID Parsing

**Issue:**
- Bulk delete and download operations failed with: `ValueError: Field 'id' expected a number but got 'photo-383'`
- Frontend sends prefixed IDs like "photo-383" or "video-42" from checkboxes
- Backend expected raw numeric IDs

**Solution:**
- Added ID parsing logic to extract media type and numeric ID
- Format: Split on '-', get type (photo/video) and numeric ID
- Try appropriate model based on parsed type

**Implementation:**
```python
# Parse ID format: "photo-383" or "video-42"
parts = media_id.split('-')
media_type = parts[0]
numeric_id = int(parts[1])

if media_type == 'photo':
    media_obj = Photo.objects.get(pk=numeric_id)
elif media_type == 'video':
    media_obj = Video.objects.get(pk=numeric_id)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `album/views/media_views.py` - Updated `bulk_delete` (lines 589-640)
- `album/views/media_views.py` - Updated `bulk_download` (lines 654-710)

---

### 2. Album Cover Display for Video-Only Albums

**Issue:**
- Albums containing only videos didn't show cover images
- Template only checked for `album.photos.first.thumbnail`
- Videos have thumbnails too but weren't being used

**Solution:**
- Added fallback chain: cover_image ‚Üí photos.first.thumbnail ‚Üí videos.first.thumbnail
- Updated both dashboard and album list templates

**Implementation:**
```django
{% if album.cover_image %}
    <img src="{{ album.cover_image.url }}" alt="{{ album.title }}">
{% elif album.photos.first.thumbnail %}
    <img src="{{ album.photos.first.thumbnail.url }}" alt="{{ album.title }}">
{% elif album.videos.first.thumbnail %}
    <img src="{{ album.videos.first.thumbnail.url }}" alt="{{ album.title }}">
{% else %}
    <div class="no-cover">No Cover</div>
{% endif %}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `album/templates/album/dashboard.html` - Line 63
- `album/templates/album/album_list.html` - Line 243

---

### 3. Upload Album Pre-selection

**Issue:**
- Clicking "Add Media" from album dashboard didn't pre-select the target album
- Users had to manually select album from dropdown after navigating

**Solution:**
- Read `?album=` query parameter from URL
- Validate user owns/can access the album
- Pre-populate form with selected album

**Implementation:**
```python
album_id = request.GET.get('album')
if album_id:
    album = Album.objects.get(pk=album_id)
    if request.user == album.owner or request.user.is_superuser:
        initial_data['album'] = album
```

**Files Modified:**
- `album/views/media_views.py` - Updated `minimal_upload` view (lines 1243-1256)

---

### 4. Upload Validation Before Spinner

**Issue:**
- Upload validation happened after loading spinner started
- Users saw spinner, then error about missing album selection
- Confusing UX - spinner implies processing started

**Solution:**
- Added client-side validation before showing spinner
- Check album selection first
- Show alert and prevent submission if invalid

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const albumSelect = document.querySelector('select[name="album"]');
if (!albumSelect || !albumSelect.value) {
    alert('Please select an album before uploading.');
    event.preventDefault();
    return false;
}
// Show spinner only after validation passes
```

**Files Modified:**
- `album/static/album/js/minimal_upload.js` - Updated `confirmUpload()` function

## üß™ Testing Performed

### Database Migration
```bash
‚úÖ Migration 0007_add_album_admin_processing_limit created
‚úÖ Migration applied successfully
‚úÖ Setting loads correctly with default value of 50
‚úÖ Setting can be modified and persisted
```

## üîÑ Rollback Information

If you need to rollback these changes:

### Revert Migration
```bash
python manage.py migrate album 0006  # Or previous migration number
```

### Revert Code Changes
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
# Or manually restore from backup
```

### Remove Volume Mounts (Production)
In `docker-compose.yml`, remove or comment out these lines:
```yaml
# Code volumes for development (remove for production)
- ./album:/app/album
- ./photo_album:/app/photo_album
- ./manage.py:/app/manage.py
```

---

## üìù Notes for Deployment

### Production Considerations:

1. **Remove Development Volumes:**
   - Comment out code volume mounts in docker-compose.yml
   - Rebuild Docker image with `docker-compose build web`
   - Code will be baked into image (no live reloading)

2. **Set Album Admin Limit:**
   - Review and adjust `album_admin_processing_limit` for your environment
   - Consider server resources and user base
   - Default of 50 is conservative and safe

3. **Verify Permissions:**
   - Test album owner access to AI processing
   - Ensure site admins retain unlimited access
   - Check that album-scoped filtering works correctly

4. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Watch AI processing loads with new album owner access
   - Adjust limits if system becomes overloaded
   - GPU acceleration helps with higher limits
