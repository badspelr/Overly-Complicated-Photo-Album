   ```
   http://localhost:8000/videos/<video_id>/
   ```

2. **Check buttons appear** (if you're the owner/viewer):
   - Should see "Edit Metadata" button (yellow/warning)
   - Should see "Delete Video" button (red/danger)

3. **Click "Edit Metadata"**:
   - Should load edit form with current video data
   - Form fields should be pre-populated

4. **Make changes and save**:
   - Should show success message
   - Should redirect back to video detail
   - Changes should be visible

5. **Test permissions**:
   - Login as owner → should see buttons ✅
   - Login as viewer → should see buttons ✅
   - Login as other user → should NOT see buttons ❌
   - Not logged in → should NOT see buttons ❌
