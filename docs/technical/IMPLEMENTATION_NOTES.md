## üîí Album Owner Permissions Fix

**Implementation Date:** October 18, 2025

### Problem
Global "Album Admin" group gave users admin rights to **ALL albums**, including albums owned by other users. This was a major privilege escalation vulnerability:
- User B could edit/delete User A's albums
- Any user in "Album Admin" group had system-wide album permissions
- No proper per-album ownership model

### Solution
Eliminated the global Album Admin group and implemented per-album ownership model:

#### Changes Made

1. **Removed Global Group**
   - Deleted "Album Admin" group from Django auth groups
   - Removed all users from this group
   - Now using `album.owner` field for permissions

2. **Updated Permission Checks**
   - Changed from `is_album_admin(user)` to `is_album_admin(user, album)`
   - Album owners are automatically admins of ONLY their own albums
   - Site superusers retain system-wide access

3. **Code Changes**
   - **Middleware**: Updated to use `is_album_owner` instead of global group check
   - **Views**: All permission checks now verify specific album ownership
   - **Templates**: Updated permission logic in album templates
   - **URLs**: Removed `album_admin_users` view (no longer needed)

4. **Migration**
   - All existing albums retain their owner
   - Users who were in Album Admin group now only admin their own albums
   - No data loss or disruption

#### Files Modified
- `album/middleware.py` - Permission checking logic
- `album/views/album_views.py` - Album management views
- `album/urls.py` - Removed admin users URL
- `album/models.py` - Verified owner field usage
- Multiple templates - Updated permission checks

### Security Impact
- ‚úÖ Fixed privilege escalation vulnerability
- ‚úÖ Proper isolation between user albums
- ‚úÖ Album owners control only their own content
- ‚úÖ Site admins retain necessary access

## üß≠ Invite User Navigation Fix

**Implementation Date:** October 18, 2025

### Problem
After inviting a user to an album, clicking "Back to Album" returned to the album detail page instead of the intended previous page (which could be search results, favorite albums, or custom album views).

### Solution
Implemented proper return URL preservation across the invitation flow:

#### Changes Made

1. **URL Parameter Preservation**
   - Added `return_url` parameter to invitation links
   - Encoded return URLs for safe transmission
   - Preserved through invitation form submission

2. **Code Updates**
   ```python
   # In album_detail.html - preserve current URL
   <a href="{% url 'invite_user' album.pk %}?return_url={{ request.get_full_path|urlencode }}">

   # In invite_user view - redirect to return_url after success
   return_url = request.GET.get('return_url') or request.POST.get('return_url')
   if return_url:
       return redirect(return_url)
   return redirect('album_detail', pk=album.pk)
   ```

3. **Template Updates**
   - Updated `album_detail.html` invite links
   - Modified `invite_user.html` form to include return_url
   - Added return_url to all invitation-related links

#### Files Modified
- `album/views/album_views.py` - `invite_user()` view
- `album/templates/album/album_detail.html` - Invite links
- `album/templates/album/invite_user.html` - Form handling

### User Experience Impact
- ‚úÖ Users return to their original context after inviting
- ‚úÖ Workflow is more intuitive
- ‚úÖ No more "where did I come from?" confusion
- ‚úÖ Works with search, favorites, custom albums
