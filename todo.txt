This is top 5% quality for portfolio projects.
================================================================================

## HIGH PRIORITY
- Create Android app as frontend for photo album (native app with Django REST API backend for mobile photo browsing, AI search, camera integration, and offline access)

## Low Priority

SECURITY FIX COMPLETED: Fixed major security vulnerability where users could assign themselves admin privileges
- Created separate forms: CustomUserChangeForm (basic profile) vs AdminUserChangeForm (with groups)  
- UserUpdateView now only allows basic profile editing (no group management)
- UserEditView uses appropriate form based on admin level
- Fixed users without group assignments - all non-superusers now have Viewer group

PERMISSION SYSTEM REDESIGN COMPLETED: Fixed album admin privilege escalation
- PROBLEM: Global "Album Admin" group gave users admin rights to ALL albums (User B could admin User A's albums)
- SOLUTION: Eliminated global Album Admin group, now using per-album ownership model
- Album owners are automatically admins of ONLY their own albums
- Removed AlbumAdminUsersView and album_admin_users URL
- Updated middleware to use is_album_owner instead of is_album_admin
- Updated all permission checks to use album.owner or is_album_admin(user, album)
- Removed all users from Album Admin group - now using owner field for permissions

ACCOUNT DELETION FEATURE COMPLETED: Users can now delete their accounts and all data
- Added AccountDeleteView with proper permission checks (users can only delete own account)
- Created delete_account.html template with data summary and warnings
- Shows count of albums, photos, videos, tags, and custom albums that will be deleted
- Requires explicit confirmation checkbox and double confirmation dialog
- CASCADE deletion automatically removes all user's data: albums, photos, videos, tags, custom albums, share links, favorites
- Added "Danger Zone" section to profile page with delete account link
- GDPR compliant - complete data removal upon account deletion

## Completed
- ✅ **Slideshow fix** - Fixed slideshow to load ALL photos from album instead of just 20 visible on current page; created FlexiblePageNumberPagination class allowing page_size query parameter up to 10,000 items; updated slideshow.js to fetch photos via API (/api/albums/{id}/media/?media_type=photos&page_size=1000) instead of DOM scraping; added fallback to page loading if API fails; slideshow remains photos-only (no videos)
- ✅ **Album form checkbox styling** - Fixed "Is Public" checkbox alignment on album create/edit pages; checkbox now appears to the right of label text with proper spacing; added verbose_name='Is Public' to model field for proper capitalization
- ✅ **Smart delete navigation** - After deleting a photo/video, users are now redirected to the next item in the album instead of the dashboard; improves workflow for cleaning up albums; falls back to previous item or album page if no next item exists
- ✅ **Django Admin Performance Fix** - Fixed album admin loading all photos/videos causing performance issues; Removed PhotoInline and VideoInline (caused N+1 query problem); Added smart navigation with "Manage Photos" and "Manage Videos" buttons that link to filtered lists; Added thumbnail previews in photo/video lists; Added image/video preview in edit forms; Added pagination (50 per page); Result: Album with 100+ photos now loads instantly instead of 30+ seconds or timeout
- ✅ **Removed Python virtual environment from Docker workflow** - Eliminated redundant venv in Docker containers; Docker provides complete isolation (separate filesystem, Python installation, dependencies); Created cleanup script (scripts/remove_venv.sh) to automate removal; Updated README.md and INSTALL.md to emphasize Docker-first approach with "No virtual environment needed!" messaging; Kept .gitignore entries for developers using local development; Docker philosophy: one container = one isolated environment, no venv required
- ✅ **Production deployment documentation and automation** - Created PRODUCTION_QUICK_START.md (5-minute deployment guide), deploy_to_production.sh (automated build/push/package script), check_production_ready.sh (pre-deployment validation), deploy.sh (production server deployment), DEPLOYMENT_CHEAT_SHEET.md (one-page quick reference); Updated DOCKER.md section 8 with "From Development to Production" guide explaining why production is easier than development (comparison table, registry workflow, production considerations, update procedures); Provides complete automation from development to production deployment
- ✅ **Celery production validation checklist** - Created comprehensive CELERY_PRODUCTION_VALIDATION.md with 8 validation tests, monitoring procedures, troubleshooting guide, and sign-off checklist to verify Celery workers ready for production deployment
- ✅ **Terms of Conduct and CSAM Policy** - Created TERMS_OF_CONDUCT.md (18 sections: acceptable use, content ownership, privacy/GDPR, moderation, termination) and CSAM_POLICY.md (zero tolerance, detection mechanisms, 1-hour response, NCMEC reporting, law enforcement cooperation); both production-ready with customization notes
- ✅ **Documentation consolidation** - Merged related docs: DOCKER_GUIDE.md + DOCKER_RESOURCE_GUIDE.md → DOCKER.md (comprehensive 600+ line guide); CELERY_SETUP.md + CELERY_QUICKREF.md → CELERY.md (complete Celery guide); All technical notes → IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md (consolidated change history); Updated documentation indexes and quick reference; Total reduction: 20 files → 13 files (35% reduction)
- ✅ **Documentation reorganization** - Moved all documentation from root to organized `docs/` directory structure with categories: getting-started, user-guides, admin-guides, deployment, technical; created comprehensive docs/README.md index with navigation; created professional README.md for root; reduced root clutter from 17 MD files to just README.md and CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ **Review all documentation and update as needed** - Updated CHANGELOG.md with v1.2.0 release notes (AI Settings, Cookie Consent, Comprehensive User Manual, About/Contact pages); Enhanced OVERVIEW.md with new Administrative Features section, GDPR compliance, and Documentation & Help section; Added note to USER_MANUAL.md directing users to HTML version at /user-manual/

- ✅ Fixed album owner permissions across the system - updated invite_user, dashboard display, AI processing, and user deletion to properly recognize is_album_owner instead of obsolete is_album_admin
- ✅ Sorting features fully implemented - album pages have 6 sort options (date taken/added newest/oldest, title A-Z/Z-A), global search has 7 sort fields (date, title, width, height, duration, file size) with independent direction control, all sorting works with filters and pagination
- ✅ Complete AI processing admin interface - created /ai-settings/ page for configuring auto-processing, scheduled processing, batch size, and timeouts; added navigation links for site admins; AIProcessingSettings singleton model with form-based management; manual trigger buttons already existed at /process-photos-ai/ and /process-videos-ai/
